# What is ML Studio?

  enable: true
  title: "What is ML Studio?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    We want to make it possible for Data Scientists and Engineers to spend their time on hard and creative ML tasks by
    easily leveraging the cloud (on-prem or public).
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    <b>ML Studio</b> is built around a few open-source tools your already use and other tools we build ourselves to make
    your life easier:
    <ul>
      <li><b>GIT</b>: track your work and deployments configuration</li>
      <li><b>Docker</b>: build your deployment images and deploy your work inside your k8s cluster</li>
      <li><b>Voyager</b>: a simple but handy lightweight data visualization tool</li>
      <li><b>Conda</b>: manage your Python environments</li>
      <li><b>Jupyter</b>: our online IDE of choice</li>
      <li><b>Boiler</b>: a tool we built to help you manage all your deployments</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    None of the tools we built are designed to lock you in.
    </p>'

# How it works?
how_it_works:
  enable: true
  title: "How it works?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    If you are already using Git then you are going to fit right in because every change is tracked in Git automatically.
    Individual deployment configuration is tracked inside your Git repo under <code>.mlstudio/app.db</code>,
    it is SQLite database. And artifacts are stored in <code>/home/mlstudio/models</code> directory so together with
    the related deployment configuration you can reproduce the same results and review the code that leads to them.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    All that is open because we do not want to lock you in, we believe that after you try ML Studio you will be
    hooked. And if you ever feel want to leave you know that all your work and deployments configuration are yours
    and that you will be taking them with you.

    ML Studio is free during Early Access Program (EAP). EAP users have full access to all the product features.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    <b>$150 monthly per installation</b>. A good Laptop for Machine Learning costs about $2,000 so we charge under that yearly per
    installation not per user and we offer features like NoOps deployments and eventually
    testing (A/B, canary, ...) on top of that.
    </p>

    We are building ML Studio for ourselves. We got sick switching between local and cloud environments
    and depending on other teams to get my work into production. And testing different solutions in production was a nightmare.

    <p class="lead">
    There seem to be a class of users like us, and we want to help you with these reoccurring problems that we can
    add solutions to. Data management, deployments, and testing, for example, are huge pain points.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    Calibration and other productivity features are some of the thing we will to focus on in the future.
